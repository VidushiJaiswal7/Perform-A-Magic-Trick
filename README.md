# Summary

This application was created specifically for Udacity's  Learn ARKit with Swift Nanodegree Program. Perform a Magic trick is an AR app that is a ball toss game. The app consists of placing a 3D hat on a detected real-world surface, throwing balls in the hat, followed by vanishing all the balls captured within the hat.

# Technologies Used

Swift, Auto Layout, ARKit, SceneKit, Particle Systems, Animations, UIKit Components

# How to use
Open the project using Xcode, and run the project on a physical device. Make sure a development team is assigned.
Allow the camera access and follow on screen instructions.
Once a horizontal plane has been detected, a hat will be placed on that surface.
Press 'Throw Ball' button to shoot a ball perpendicular to your camera screen.
Keep shooting till you are satisfied and then press the 'Magic' button, which will remove all the balls present inside the hat (leaving the balls outside as it is).


# Conclusion

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I learned how to create 3D objects with SceneKit, how to anchor 3D objects to real-world positions, how to apply physics to 3D objects and how to solve and debug issues encountered while developing an AR app.
